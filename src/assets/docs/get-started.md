## Step 2
**Add a Guild**
[Login]([https://DList.co/login) to the DList Dashboard to your server.
This will redirect you to a Discord oauth link which should auto login to DList, with your currently logged-in Discord account.
After logging into the dashboard, you can [add a guild](/dashboard/guilds/new) by clicking on the '+' icon.
