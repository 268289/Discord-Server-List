# Reviewing

---

Reviewers ensure guilds follow the [Guild Guidelines](/guild-guidelines), which are high standards to ensure the quality of every user experience.

### Reviewers Should
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in guilds, and let guild developers know
- Help users understand why they were approved/declined
- Not take any guild developer feedback too personally

They help keep users safe from any threats, and help maintain balance and stability.

## Reviewers
